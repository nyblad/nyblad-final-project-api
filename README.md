# Project 18 - Mongo API Project

Week 18 @ Technigo Bootcamp we we're challenged to build an API again, but this time we needed to model our database using Mongoose models, and persist our data in the database.

API: https://nyblad-guest-list.herokuapp.com/  <br>
Example endpoint with queries: https://nyblad-guest-list.herokuapp.com/guests?attending=true&name=sofied <br>

Front end to try out: https://the-nyblad-wedding.netlify.com/guests <br>
(This API will be a part of my final project so heads up that the link to frontend doesn't work in future due to changes during the project)

## Learning objectives

* How to model data in Mongoose <br>
* How to fetch items from a Mongo database using Mongoose <br>
* How to seed large amounts of data to a database <br>

## Technologies used

* MongoDB <br>
* Mongoose <br>
* Express <br>
* JavaScript ES6 <br>
